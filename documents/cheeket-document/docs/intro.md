# cheeket

A lightweight and extensible IoC framework

## Introduction

cheeket is a new IoC framework, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation. By leveraging async functions, cheeket allows you to inject dependency as async. cheeket allows you to easily extend functionality and manage the lifecycle of your dependencies through middleware and event listeners. 

## Installation
```bash npm2yarn
npm install cheeket
```
